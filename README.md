# Beginning Serverless Architectures with Microsoft Azure
Serverless technology abstracts away all underlying servers and infrastructure, allowing technology teams to focus on delivering business value rather than managing infrastructure. It offers several advantages over container technologies like Docker. Containers require management themselves, with DevOps teams generally configuring them, managing deployments and ensuring they are scaled appropriately. Serverless technologies scale totally automatically and are only charged by usage. Deployments are done using simple deployment slots. There is no configuration beyond connection strings that are injected on deployment because the code has to be written without any assumptions about the server it is running on.


## What you will learn
* Learn what serverless is?
* Learn the benefits of serverless technologies, with particular focus on the NoOps nature reducing infrastructure management difficulties and costs
* Learn what serverless components Azure offers
* Learn how to use these components to create loosely-coupled applications that can scale


### Hardware requirements
For an optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* **Processor**: 2.6 GHz or higher, preferably multi-core
* **Memory**: 4GB RAM
* **Hard disk**: 35GB or more
* An Internet connection



### Software requirements
Youâ€™ll also need the following software installed in advance:
* Operating System: Windows (8 or higher).
* [Postman](www.getpostman.com)
* Visual Studio 2017 with Azure Development Workflow installed
